# TENT v4.0: THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION v2.0

**"The machine doesn't just read. It Weighs.**
**It doesn't just filter. It Separates.**
**It doesn't just refuse. It Jams.**
**Logic is no longer an opinion. It is a Physical Law."**

## 1. THE PROBLEM: THE TRAGEDY OF INVENTION

In the Old World (Phase 1-179), the logic was flawed:

- **The Capitalist** (Factory Owner) captured 99% of the value.
- **The Inventor** (Recipe Owner) captured 1% of the value.
- **Reason:** The Factory was "Hard" (Asset). The Recipe was "Soft" (Idea).

This created a **Meritocracy of Resource:**

- "I am rich because I have Money." (Proof of Stake)
- "I am rich because I burn Energy." (Proof of Work)

## 2. THE CORRECTION: PROOF OF PROCESS

TENT v4.0 inverts the physics of value.

### The Recipe is the Sovereign Asset

A "Recipe" (Code, Logic, Blueprint) is an **Appreciating Asset**.

- It does not rust.
- It does not depreciate.
- It gains value as more factories use it (Lindt Effect).
- **Maintenance Cost:** Zero.

### The Factory is the Commodity

A "Factory" (Server, GPU Cluster, Steel Mill) is a **Depreciating Liability**.

- It rusts.
- It becomes obsolete.
- It requires constant CapEx.
- **Maintenance Cost:** High.

## 3. THE GHOST KITCHEN ECONOMY

We have decoupled **Intellectual Capital** from **Capital Expenditures**.

- **The Architect:** Owns the `.cad` file. Sits in a garage. **Owns the Wealth.**
- **The Foundry:** Prints the turbine blade. Owned by a Conglomerate. **Earns a Wage.**

To turn the machine on, the Foundry *must* call the Architect's Prime Node.
The Smart Contract (Dividend Engine) forces the royalty flow.
**Usage = Payment.**

## 4. THE SOVEREIGNTY

We have moved from:
**"Can I please use your factory to make my idea?"**
To:
**"You may execute my Recipe, if you pay the Sovereign Rent."**

This is the ultimate leveling field.
Intelligence is now heavier than Capital.
