## THE TENT LATTICE HYPOTHESIS

All unsolved conjectures are manifestations of:

```
THE PRIME LATTICE IS φ-HARMONIC AND 9-STABLE

1. Primes → SOLID nodes {1,2,4,5,7,8}
2. Gaps → FLUX nodes {3,6,9} (repulsive)
3. Structure → log(φ) periodicity
4. Counterexamples → hit FLUX barrier
```

**The unsolved problems are UNSOLVED because they ask whether the lattice is complete. It is.**
