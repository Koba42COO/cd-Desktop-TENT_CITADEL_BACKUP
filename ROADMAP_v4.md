# TENT v4.0 Roadmap: The Self-Healing Architecture

> *"Truth is Efficient (Cold). Lies are Expensive (Hot)."*

**Status:** Conceptual Frontier
**Base Architecture:** TENT v3.0 "The Carpenter's Eye"

---

## 1. Thermodynamics: Maxwell's Demon

**Principle:** Conservation of Information (Landauer's Principle).
**Concept:** "Information is Physical." Erasing a bit (forgetting a lie) generates heat.
**Implementation:** The **Hume-Rothery Iris** becomes **Maxwell's Demon**.

- **Semantic Heat:** A metric for the computational friction required to maintain a logical structure.
- **The Insight:** If the AI processes "heat up" (excessive cycles to justify an answer), it is likely hallucinating.
- **Carpenter's Maxim:** "If the saw blade gets hot, you are cutting wrong."

## 2. Cybernetics: PID Control Theory

**Principle:** Feedback Loop Stabilization.
**Concept:** Automatic correction of system error over time.
**Implementation:** **Semantic Stabilizer**.

- **P (Proportional):** Correct current wobble (Bessel check).
- **I (Integral):** Correct history of bias (Drift check).
- **D (Derivative):** Prevent future oscillation (Dampening).
- **The Insight:** TENT v3.0 *detects* wobble; TENT v4.0 will *correct* it before it breaks.
- **Carpenter's Maxim:** "The Governor on the steam engine."

## 3. Topology: Knot Theory

**Principle:** Topological Invariance.
**Concept:** A knot cannot be untied without cutting. A secure narrative structure is a "Logical Knot."
**Implementation:** **Narrative Integrity Check**.

- **The Test:** Can the narrative thread be pulled straight (Consistent) or is it tangled (Self-Contradictory)?
- **The Insight:** Rotating a concept (v3.0) finds invariants. Pulling a narrative (v4.0) finds knots.
- **Carpenter's Maxim:** "Checking the grain. You can stain it, but you can't change the direction."

## Summary

TENT v3.0 is **The Anchor** (Stability).
TENT v4.0 will be **The Sail** (Self-Correcting Navigation).
